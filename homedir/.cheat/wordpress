# ERROR: Removing plugin causes ftp credentials prompt.
Add to wp-config.php (remove when site goes live?):
define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');

# ERROR: Plugin could not be fully removed.
#    OR: Plugin installation could not create directory.
Change wordpress files ownership to http (arch) or www-data (debian).
Permissions: 664 for files and 775 for dirs.

# ERROR: 'not a valid JSON response' when creating a new page or post.
This happens because the webserver does not allow overrides in the .htaccess
file (eg. to change the permalink url).
Solution: in httpd.conf set 'AllowOverride FileInfo' in <Directory "/srv/http">
